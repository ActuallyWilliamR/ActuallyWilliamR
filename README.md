# Hello there! 
# My name is William Rossander!

I've always been deeply interested in technology in all its forms such as hardware, software and video games.
I have for many years been curious about coding and software development as a whole, but never taken the step to create things on my own.

That recently changed.

I decided to challenge myself and take a more serious path into development, which led me to apply for and begin studying **Java Development with Cloud Focus**.
This marks the start of my transistion from being a technology enthusiast to actively building, experimenting, and learning through hands-on projects.

## About me
- Aspiring Java developer with a cloud-oriented mindset.
- Strong interest in understanding how systems work under the hood.
- Enjoys problem-solving and structured learning.
- Motivated by continuous improvement and long-term growth.

## Current Focus
- Developing a strong understanding of the programming language as a whole.
- Jave fundementals and object-oriented programming.
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Version control with Git and GitHub.

## Goals
- Build a solid foundation as a developer.
- Create well-structured projects that prepares me for real-world scenarios.
- Grow into a professional role within software development and cloud technologies.

This is but a taste of my long journey to come.
I look forward to learning, building, and one day contributing to something bigger.
